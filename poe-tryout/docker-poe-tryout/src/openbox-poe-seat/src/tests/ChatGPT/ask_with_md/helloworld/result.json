Here's an example of a Markdown file with a heading using the \"#\" symbol:\napplescript Copy# Heading 1\n\nThis is some text under the heading.\n\n## Heading 2\n\nThis is some more text under the second heading.\n\n### Heading 3\n\nAnd here's another level of heading.\n\n#### Heading 4\n\nHeading 4 is smaller than Heading 3.\n\n##### Heading 5\n\nHeading 5 is even smaller.\n\n###### Heading 6\n\nHeading 6 is the smallest.\n\n\nIn Markdown, the \"#\" symbol is used to denote headings. The number of \"#\" symbols determines the level of the heading, with one \"#\" for Heading 1, two \"##\" for Heading 2, and so on. The text following the \"#\" symbol is the content of the heading."
