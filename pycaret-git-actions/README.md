# Disclosure

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Each Account comes with included compute and storage quantities for use with Actions, depending on your Account plan, which can be found in the Actions documentation.
Actions and any elements of the Action service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, or the GitHub Actions service limitations. Additionally, Actions should not be used for:

- cryptomining;
- serverless computing; 
- using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program)
- the provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Actions or any elements of Actions for commercial purposes; or,
- any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, or restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions.
